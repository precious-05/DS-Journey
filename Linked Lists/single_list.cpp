//Single Linked List: It consists of sequence of elements called nodes containing 2 parts. " Data " & " Pointer to next node "
//The traversing is done in forward direction only


//       |Head|----->[data|next]-->[data|next]-->[data|next]-->[data|next]-->[data|next]-->[data|next]----->NULL

//--------------------------------------------Implementation of Linked List-----------------------------------------------------
//In Linked list each element is stored in the form of node. 
//So the 1st step is to define the Node
